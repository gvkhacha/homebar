# Homebar

This is a project intended for personal growth and use at home. It uses a full stack MERN approach for displaying, editing, and maintaining recipes for cocktails and alcoholic beverages to make at home. Admin features include adding or editing recipes, as well as maintaining an inventory to show available drinks.


###### Remake Note
I re-started this project with the intention of having a strong back end with authentication/authorization, as well as using Redux in front end. I tried to "merge" the two repositories, but ended up losing the previous commits entirely. All work done before December 26 was lost on Github.
